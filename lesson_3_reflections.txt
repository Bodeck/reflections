When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
In case I want to publish/share most up to date version of master branch.
Also when I do not have access to local repo I can clone it from public - off course if it is up to date.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This gives me full control on my local repository, so I do not pull unwanted changes/commits.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
clone: is copy of existing repository (remote or local). Commits done in local clone can be pushed origin repository.
branch: Branches are part of the same repository. Can be merged back into one branch.
forks: similar of tho clone are copy of original repository, but can be done only on GitHub
